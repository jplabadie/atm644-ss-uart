# atm644-ss-uart
A C project for simon-says via UART using the ATMega644 breadboarded with some other components

## Overview

This is the code I used for a project done in an Embedded Systems course with Ryan Middleton at NAU. My project utilizes a USB UART interface along with a few 
other features of the AtMega 644 microcontroller. The video demo of the finished project is on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STp4PL5Zmk0

I will try to upload more details concerning the hardware here when I get the time.
